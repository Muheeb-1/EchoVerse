# test_granite.py
"""
Robust test for your Granite / HF-based rewrite function.

Behavior:
- Tries to import rewrite_with_hf from services.rewrite.
- If the import or HF API key is missing, falls back to a safe local stub.
- Prints the rewritten output or an error message for easy debugging.
